Data Visualization I
1. Use the inbuilt dataset 'titanic'. The dataset contains 891 rows and contains information
about the passengers who boarded the unfortunate Titanic ship. Use the Seaborn library
to see if we can find any patterns in the data.
2. Write a code to check how the price of the ticket (column name: 'fare') for each
passenger is distributed by plotting a histogram

IN CODE :-
1. import pandas as pd
   Purpose: Powerful data analysis and data manipulation tool.
2.  import numpy as np
Purpose: Fundamental library for numerical computations in Python.
3. import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
Purpose: Core plotting library for visualizing data.
4. import seaborn as sns
Purpose: High-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics (built on top of matplotlib).sns.heatmap(), sns.countplot(), sns.boxplot()
5. dataset.describe() is a Pandas function that provides a statistical summary of the numeric columns in a DataFrame.
6. dataset.dtypes is a Pandas attribute that returns the data type of each column in a DataFrame
7. dataset.isnull().sum() is a Pandas command used to identify and count missing (null) values in each column of a DataFrame.

üîç What it does:
isnull() creates a DataFrame of the same shape with True where values are missing.

sum() adds up True values (treated as 1), giving the count of missing values per column.

8. A DataFrame is a 2-dimensional, tabular data structure in Pandas (Python library), similar to an Excel spreadsheet or an SQL table.
9. The line sns.distplot(dataset['Fare']) uses Seaborn to plot the distribution of the Fare column from a dataset‚Äîtypically used in datasets like Titanic.
10. The line sns.distplot(dataset['Fare']) uses Seaborn to plot the distribution of the Fare column from a dataset‚Äîtypically used in datasets like Titanic.If you pass a hue='column_name', it color-codes the plots by category.

ALGORITHM :-
1. Install and import required libraries
2. titanic dataset is built into seaborn making it easy to load
3. understanding dataset structure by checking basic information - dataset.info() , dataset,describe()
4. checking for missing values to understand data quality
5. distribution of ticket prices using hostogram
6. histogram with defined number of bins to get better insight
7. scatterplot between age and fare
8. rugplot for fare distribution
9. barplot for avg based on gender
10. countplot to show the frequency distribution of fare values
11. box plot with hue for survival analysis
12. vision plot for age distribution by survival
